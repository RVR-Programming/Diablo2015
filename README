First, some terminology.

Project:        the collection of files that go in to making the Robot run.
Source files:   the files located within the 'src' directory. These files are
                written entirely in Java, and are the crux of the program.
JVM:            the program that is able to execute Java bytecode.
Compile:        the translation of human-readable pseudo-english text into 
                JVM-parsable bytecode. Build is mostly a synonym for compile.
Build script:   a script, build.xml in particular, that is read by a certain 
                tool, in this case the tool is ant. The build script builds the
                project, and then distributes it. It is the job of this script
                to get the necessary files on to the robot.
Library:        a pre-compiled project that provides tools and utilities for
                use by the Project.
WPILib:         the library distributed by FIRST, developed by Worcester 
                Polytechnic Institute. It is this library which deals with the
                interaction between low level electronic mechanisms and the
